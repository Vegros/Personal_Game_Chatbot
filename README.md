# Personal_Game_Chatbot

## Description

This project consists of python {flask} and HTML. The program allows the user to get information about a game of the user choice, it can show a list of games that suits the user requirements and also can compare 2 games with each other and give the percentage of how similar they are.

## How to run the project 

### Imports

To run the project on PyCharm or any Python IDE, make sure you have all these imports installed. You can install them via pip install.

- flask: `pip install flask`
- nltk: `pip install nltk`
- scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
- numpy: `pip install numpy`
- lxml: `pip install lxml`
- beautifulsoup4: `pip install beautifulsoup4`
- requests: `pip install requests`
- requests_html: `pip install requests_html`
- selenium: `pip install selenium`

Important: Make sure to have `nltk.download('stopwords')` and `nltk.download('wordnet')` installed. Otherwise, it will not work!

After all these are installed, open the project in PyCharm or any Python IDE and run the `app.py` file as the Flask application configuration. Important: You must run the `app.py` file in order for the program to work. Then it will give you a local URL, click it, and it will redirect you to the web page. 

You can also run the project via `app.py` after you extract the zip file. This will work if you have all the imports downloaded on the computer. If the project is too zoomed in, you can click `Ctrl +` or `Ctrl -` to adjust this.
